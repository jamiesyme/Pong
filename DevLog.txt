- Whoops, forgot to document stuff! It's tough getting back into the habit!
- To sum it all up:
	- Score was implemented. Both sides have points that can be reset.(font_bold.ttf)
	- The "Reset" button works now.
	- Particle effects! Whenever the ball collides, some particles are spawned, and it looks dope!
	- Ball "ghosts". Adds the trail you see behind the ball.
- Collision needs to be fixed... the ball keeps on going right through paddles!
- Annnnd I fixed collisions! :) I saved the coordinates before the ball->Update() and after, and then used those to check if DURING that update, any collisions happened. The physics are now pretty solid, even at quite high speeds!

- I'm having second thoughts about my Screen setup..
- Also, the screens reference Game directly. I might have to change that.
- Finally, the right paddle's position will have to be set in Game, so it is always correct. (or something more drastic)

- Wow. That intro screen looks magnificent now! :D

- We need double buffering. Like, 100%.
- Also, we need... *got to the exchange... I don't remember what I was about to say*
